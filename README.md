# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts

## Introduction

In the future, you will need to understand deep statistical concepts by reading technical articles. As a training for that, it is interesting to start from here. Also, as we have limited time, this is a way to have some self guided learning to understand everything better and have a wider knowledge.

This week you will find some questions here that you will need to answer by documentating yourself. So you will do a different PR for each question (you are meant to answer the questions in different days). Don't hesitate to write as many text as you need and push images if you need them.

Remember for this lab: there is a right answer. But there is no perfect way to explain it (except for in a mathematical way, but this is another story).

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
The mean can be used to measure the average value in a frequency distribution. The frequency distribution shows the number of instances in which a variable takes each of its possible values.

In contrast, the expected value is used to measure the average value in a probability distribution. The probability distribution consists of random variables and their probabilities. 

### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
The problem with P values is that they categorize all results into statistically signficant or non-significant, when in fact the validity of a study's findings sits in a realm of uncertainty. By trying to find 'yes' or 'no' answers to hypotheses, we lose a lot of valuable information about a study which can help us to understand if it's results are actually valuable. 

### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
I have no idea what is required here. 

## Deliverables
You need to submit a markdown file with the answers to the questions above. You can create a new `.md` file or directly edit the `README.md`.

## Submission
Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
