    "- The problem with p-value is that it is often misinterpreted in instances where the p-value is higher than the significance level. When it is, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (the null usually representing similarity of two subsets), and instead incorrectly assume that we are accepting it as the truth. In reality the only conclusion we can make is that it may be true, but we don't know.\n",
    "- The issue lies in us believing the dichotomy of it - if not this, then the opposite - either statistically significant or not significant. It is more fluid than that.\n",
    "- We need to take into consideration that there is a random component to most tests and thus even if we try to replicate a given test to a tee, we may results in very different p-values given the initial randomization."
