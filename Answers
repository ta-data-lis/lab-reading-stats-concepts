Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
The mean value is a statistical generalization of multiple occurrences of an event.
The expected value refers to a single event that will happen in the future. 
The expected value is numerically the same as the average value, but it is a prediction for a specific future 
occurrence rather than a generalization across multiple occurrences.

Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
The following list clarifies some issues that are commonly misunderstood regarding p-values: 
The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, or the probability that the alternative hypothesis 
is false.
