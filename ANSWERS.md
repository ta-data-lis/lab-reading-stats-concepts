### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

It seems that both terms can be used interchangeably, and are functionally very similar, but we must be careful with what is being discussed, as they are often used in different contexts.

From what I've gathered, it looks like the 'mean' or 'average' is used when discussing samples in statistics to characterize a certain sample. The 'expected value', on the other hand, seems to be the average of all the outcomes of a certain experiment that was repeated many times.


### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
